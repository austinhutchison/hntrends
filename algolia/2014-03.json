I watched them anyway. I don\u0026#x27;t know why, but I did. I loved them. I continued watching videos- chemistry, programming, physics. I\u0026#x27;m 24 now, and I\u0026#x27;m in college pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I have straight As.

We generate large logs covering everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.

You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you\u0026#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.

Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript\u0026#x2F;Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You’ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura \u0026amp; Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress.

Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, Reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco.
