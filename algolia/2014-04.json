As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeer Review\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterface Design\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommendation Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMobile App\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcademia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed, Scale, \u0026amp; Storage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture at Academia.edu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!

We help the world exchange second-hand goods for free. 80% of things in our homes are used once per month or less. The average power drill sees 6 minutes of use in its entire lifetime. There\u0026#x27;s 3 billion ft² of self-storage space in the United States. That\u0026#x27;s, like, two San Franciscos of usable stuff—just sitting there.  Yerdle is changing that. People on yerdle give away everything from kid’s clothes to kitchen tools and electronics. And we make it easier to get something re-used rather than buy new. We aim to replace 25% of new purchases with free, second-hand goods from others. In the process, we\u0026#x27;re helping people save money and encouraging manufacturers to make better products.  We\u0026#x27;re looking for people who are passionate about our vision and who want to use their skills to make the world a better place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cpre\u003E\u003Ccode\u003E    === Team and Culture ===\\n\u003C/code\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\\nWe\u0026#x27;ve been called \u0026#x27;unrepentant hippies\u0026#x27;—and that\u0026#x27;s fine with us.

It\u0026#x27;s a close-knit team, we like to pair, and we teach each other every day.

Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st class engineer \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be used to working as part of an unsilo’d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they’re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript\u0026#x2F;Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You’ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura \u0026amp; Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You’ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs \u0026amp; databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You’ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionality\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData hungry \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou’ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You’ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You’ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you’ve helped architect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen all hours \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou’ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you’ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you’ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolver of riddles \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou won’t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you’ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn’t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread.

You’ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercially aware \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You’ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn’t fall over as its user base scales. You’ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeen eye, tuned ear \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We’ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You’ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You’ll know that most project budgets don’t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you’re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecurity and speed \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou’ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You’ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too.

As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeer Review\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterface Design\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommendation Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMobile App\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcademia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed, Scale, \u0026amp; Storage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture at Academia.edu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!

This isn’t for someone who’s just set up Elasticsearch, Solr, or some other search engine (though that helps). It’s for someone who can mine the data of customer searches and provably demonstrate they can create better search results for customers. You won’t be waiting for tasks to do: you’ll be deciding the tasks and how to do them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you exclude a location 500 meters away from the one a customer is searching for but it’s across an international boundary or a river with no bridge?

And do different categories of customers have different search needs? How would they be categorized and how would different search results impact them? Or maybe you can demonstrate that the above wouldn’t impact sales and you have a better solution?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe possibilities are endless and the position itself is very high level within the company.

As long as you are willing to work in Amsterdam, bring them up and the company will see what they can do. On top of that, you’ll probably qualify for something called the 30% ruling. This is a law passed by the Dutch government to attract top experts like you. When you qualify, you’ll be taxed on only 70% of your salary.

We do, however, expect the following:\\n- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess. - You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs. - You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. - You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two. - You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. - You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.\\nHere’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:\\n- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive - Building out new product features in our API - Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly - Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more - Creating tools to assist development and ops - Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are also looking for designers, visual and\u0026#x2F;or interaction.\u003C/p\u003E","points":1,"parent_id":7507765,"story_id":7507765,"children":[]},{"id":7641298,"created_at":"2014-04-24T16:33:29.000Z","created_at_i":1398357209,"type":"comment","author":"menocchio","text":"\u003Cp\u003EOakland, Alta Bates Summit Hospital (Sutter Health)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe finance department of Alta Bates Summit hospital is looking for a front-end developer to join our small software team in Oakland.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need a collaborator to help us build the next version of our enterprise financial reporting and budgeting application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a full time onsite contractor position, with a negotiable hourly rate starting at $60 per hour, depending on skills and experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we are looking for in an ideal candidate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Server-side programming expertise in Asp.NET and Asp.NET MVC\\n* Web development expert skills: HTML, jQuery\u0026#x2F;Bootstrap, CSS Frameworks, Javascript libraries, DOM, and Entity Framework\\n* Experience in integrating SQL Server Reporting Services ReportViewer control into the application\\n* IIS server configuration\\n* Git and provisioning experience\\n* A desire to collaborate with other members of the developer team in assisting the client\\n* Ability to code to design and business logic requirements\\n* Strong communication skills – ability to translate the client’s business logic and UX requirements to technical requirements and vice-versa\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterested candidates: Please contact me at kritzbd@sutterhealth.org.\u003C/p\u003E","points":1,"parent_id":7507765,"story_id":7507765,"children":[]},{"id":7512279,"created_at":"2014-04-01T22:41:39.000Z","created_at_i":1396392099,"type":"comment","author":"mathrawka","text":"\u003Cp\u003ETokyo, Japan || Full Stack Engineer || [REMOTE is a possibility]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are a pre-release startup based and are looking for full-stack engineers that are interested in Go (golang) and Bitcoin.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do \u0026quot;expense reports that don\u0026#x27;t suck!\u0026quot; (Google \u0026quot;expensify\u0026quot; to read more.) We\u0026#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u0026#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u0026#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won\u0026#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u0026#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u0026#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Super talented, in a general way. We\u0026#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing\u0026#x2F;designing\u0026#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you\u0026#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you\u0026#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u0026#x27;re this sort of person, you\u0026#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u0026#x27;t for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u0026#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u0026#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u0026#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u0026#x27;t accidentally overlook you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at \u003Ca href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ehttp:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\u0026#x2F;apply\u003C/a\u003E).
