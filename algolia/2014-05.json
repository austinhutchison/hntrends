We\u0026#x27;re trying to do something legitimately new here, so first, some background: Right now, building a mobile app means:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 (optional): Try to build a crappy version using non-native platform technologies like: HTML5, Titanium, PhoneGap, or some other solution that attempts to use or translate the web way (HTML\u0026#x2F;JS) to mobile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Spend a lot of time and money building your mobile app from scratch using native API (Cocoa\u0026#x2F;Android)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from the pain induced when you try to do (1) before (2), this is fine if you\u0026#x27;re building a complex or involved app that merits significant and dedicated time and money for development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, at Propeller, we think there is great demand for the ability to build simple mobile apps (which is why tools for (1) exist.) But, (1) sucks - it\u0026#x27;s not native, or it\u0026#x27;s native translated from web technologies, and becomes unnecessarily complicated. Method (2) works, but it\u0026#x27;s incredibly expensive because everything is being built from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHTML\u0026#x2F;JS was a great idea when shipping code was difficult, and users didn\u0026#x27;t want to install software. Everyone had a runtime already (the browser), and so simple applications were built on that platform.  First just with HTML (the \u0026lt;form\u0026gt; element) and then HTML+JS for clients that were called \u0026quot;rich\u0026quot; but just needed to do things HTML forms couldn\u0026#x27;t do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut taking this model and attempting to make it work on mobile is not only bad engineering, it\u0026#x27;s misguided! This model makes sense when you can\u0026#x27;t ship actual code to your users, but Apple changed all that by inventing[1] the App Store (straightforward) and getting users to trust it (really a big deal.) This removes the distribution problem.  Users will install your software, so you don\u0026#x27;t need to target a legacy distribution stack that was originally designed for sharing documents and a really weird language with so many quirks a book title \u0026quot;The Good Parts\u0026quot; had to be written.  It\u0026#x27;s bad engineering motivated by decisions which aren\u0026#x27;t relevant anymore. Building mobile applications on top of (or translated from) a legacy stack with so many workarounds, shims, libraries on top of libraries, Shadow DOMs, cross-browser compatibility, compile-to-JS, minification, XSS protections, and so on is just crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHTML\u0026#x2F;JS on mobile will always suck and will always play catch-up because it\u0026#x27;s built on a legacy foundation. Hell, it sucks on the desktop now too. We put up with it because the alternative isn\u0026#x27;t feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026#x2F;rant\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, there is another way! There are good ideas here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShipping code (and waiting for Apple to approve it) brings us back to the days when we had to release major versions and burn them to CDs and put them in boxes. It\u0026#x27;s un-agile. Developers love writing web apps because it\u0026#x27;s agile - they can change their application, deploy, and release their fix or feature very quickly. That\u0026#x27;s invaluable and should not be impossible on mobile. [2] So, our hypothesis is that there are a class of simple mobile apps whose behavior can be described declaratively using a simple JSON format that can be hosted statically, or delivered piecemeal as needed, or even generated dynamically a la a REST API. It could describe an app UI directly, and also how it interacts with a server API, and it could be rendered using native controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink Web apps, but instead of a legacy stack that wasn\u0026#x27;t designed for application development, a simpler and more straightforward format uniquely suited and designed for modern Internet\u0026#x2F;Web applications, taking into consideration all of the things we\u0026#x27;ve learned a modern Internet application needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now we\u0026#x27;re building (and shipping) sophisticated apps that are defined by our JSON format and rendered using 100% native controls on iOS and Android. We can update that JSON at any time to change the app on next launch. We can send down new JSON via an AJAX-like mechanism.

Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.

One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.

Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMobile App\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcademia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed, Scale, \u0026amp; Storage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture at Academia.edu\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!

We\u0026#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out.

But only if you are all of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u0026#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won\u0026#x27;t need to.

Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u0026#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u0026#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Super talented, in a general way. We\u0026#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing\u0026#x2F;designing\u0026#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you\u0026#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you\u0026#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u0026#x27;re this sort of person, you\u0026#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u0026#x27;t for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u0026#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u0026#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u0026#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u0026#x27;t accidentally overlook you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are probably many ways to do that.

Part of this reason has to do with home environment and absentee parents, but much of it has to do with inferior resources and less experienced teachers. The worst part of this problem is that if a student falls behind in any grade, they will forever be behind in every grade. So even if the probability of falling behind in 3rd grade is low (it isn\u0026#x27;t), the probability of falling behind in 3rd grade or 4th grade or 5th grade (and so on) is really high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0026#x27;s the core problem Front Row solves - it doesn\u0026#x27;t let students fall behind. And if they fall behind, it catches them up really quickly. And it does this even if the teacher isn\u0026#x27;t very good (although better teachers always help). Now, the probability of falling behind in any given grade is irrelevant, because it will never compound.
