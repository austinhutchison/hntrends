Sorry, no remote work, but Google does sponsor visas. All levels of experience welcome. We\u0026#x27;ve recently hired an ACM fellow, as well as a new college grad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course Google is hiring. So, why I posting this? Every time I tell someone I\u0026#x27;m working at Google in Madison, they\u0026#x27;re shocked that there\u0026#x27;s an office in Madison, and I often hear people complaining about the lack of interesting technical work in Madison.

There are a couple other hardware projects in the office; most hardware projects start as prototypes of crazy ideas, and go from there. The majority of people here are doing low-level systems programming, usually networking related, and a handful of people are doing data analysis (call it big data, if you like) to figure out how to optimize Google\u0026#x27;s next generation hardware and software platforms. I\u0026#x27;m sorry I can\u0026#x27;t describe projects in much more detail -- Google is pretty secretive about what goes into datacenters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe office is small (just under 30 people), and manages to avoid any bureaucracy you might expect from a big company. The work is interesting enough that in the five year history of the office, only one person has left (and he retired to a ranch in Nebraska).

We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Data-sets. Scientists don\u0026#x27;t share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#x27;re a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco.

This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease visit \u003Ca href=\"http://amacapital.net/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ehttp:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;amacapital.net\u0026#x2F;careers.html\u003C/a\u003E to learn more, and, if interested, apply to careers@amacapital.net.\u003C/p\u003E","points":1,"parent_id":6310234,"story_id":6310234,"children":[{"id":6313527,"created_at":"2013-09-02T05:06:21.000Z","created_at_i":1378098381,"type":"comment","author":"codemac","text":"\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHuh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#x27;s in most (if not all) \u0026quot;enterprise\u0026quot; storage stacks.. are you speaking about a specific type of nvram?\u003C/p\u003E","points":1,"parent_id":6310775,"story_id":6310234,"children":[{"id":6324938,"created_at":"2013-09-04T01:12:22.000Z","created_at_i":1378257142,"type":"comment","author":"amluto","text":"\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026#x27;s now (sort of) available directly.

Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \u0026quot;layers\u0026quot;, so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it\u0026#x27;s running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you\u0026#x27;re not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you\u0026#x27;re not stuck carrying two laptops around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne product that\u0026#x27;s been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don\u0026#x27;t have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We\u0026#x27;re also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files on the go (even when you don\u0026#x27;t have a network connection), and currently getting ready to release a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There\u0026#x27;s also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#x27;re not per se a virtualization company: we don\u0026#x27;t write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that.
