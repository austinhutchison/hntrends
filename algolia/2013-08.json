The company\u0026#x27;s mission is to accelerate the world\u0026#x27;s research. 3.7m academics have joined Academia.edu, and over 300k join each month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Data-sets. Scientists don\u0026#x27;t share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#x27;re a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco.

Support is mostly troubleshooting installs remotely, and development focuses on networking and low-level media elements. A note on support: we work hard to try and automate support, so the reason we ask devs to take on support issues is that it helps us focus on not having to do support for an issue once we\u0026#x27;ve automated\u0026#x2F;fixed it. We also love having a direct connection to every customer, it makes the work more meaningful (though we find it really interesting in itself).\u003C/p\u003E","points":1,"parent_id":6140191,"story_id":6139927,"children":[{"id":6177318,"created_at":"2013-08-08T04:16:52.000Z","created_at_i":1375935412,"type":"comment","author":"Agileblaze","text":"\u003Cp\u003EHello Zuviko,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is Sandy KM.

We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss. Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease visit \u003Ca href=\"http://amacapital.net/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003Ehttp:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;amacapital.net\u0026#x2F;careers.html\u003C/a\u003E to learn more, and, if interested, apply to careers@amacapital.net.\u003C/p\u003E","points":2,"parent_id":6139927,"story_id":6139927,"children":[]},{"id":6142110,"created_at":"2013-08-01T17:56:35.000Z","created_at_i":1375379795,"type":"comment","author":"meganap","text":"\u003Cp\u003ESan Francisco, CA - Full-time, permanent - MuleSoft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESr. Javascript UI Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy should you join MuleSoft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery major company is adopting more and more cloud services, AND building lots of apps themselves, AND publishing their own APIs. We\u0026#x27;re talking hundreds to thousands of integration points for a single reasonably-large enterprise to glue together. In fact, increasingly the heart of a company\u0026#x27;s applications is in the glue itself. And that makes for an exponentially-big problem for enterprises: how do you assemble numerous services into coherent business flows, efficiently and effectively, then operate them for months and years, and keep them up to date as all these APIs evolve? How do you even know all the integration endpoints and flows you have at any given time?\nAt MuleSoft, we\u0026#x27;re already solving this for thousands of companies, but now we\u0026#x27;re taking it to the next level, with CloudHub: a cloud-based environment which pairs with the widely-adopted on-premise Mule \u0026quot;bus\u0026quot; to be the nexus of an entire enterprise\u0026#x27;s integrations. In short, CloudHub is where modern enterprises run their integration glue.\nAnd that\u0026#x27;s why MuleSoft has incredible momentum with some of the biggest companies in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere do you come in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, MuleSoft is investing heavily in our CloudHub platform.

This is not a place to rest on your laurels: this is a place to make your mark on the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, you get to work on great technologies: single-page Ajax apps; client-side MVC using backbone.js building on RESTful back-end APIs; Twitter bootstrap and jQuery; LESS; grunt; node.js, of course; perhaps you\u0026#x27;ll bring in some other new technology to the stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, and maybe the coolest part: since Mule already has the world\u0026#x27;s biggest companies on board, CloudHub will have the backing of the biggest customers to drive adoption of standards, technologies, coding paradigms, etc. So this stuff is poised to make a huge impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you? You already know you can create killer UI\u0026#x27;s based on the work of designers and your own creativity; and it\u0026#x27;s a given that you\u0026#x27;re a master of all things HTML5\u0026#x2F;CSS3\u0026#x2F;JavaScript.
