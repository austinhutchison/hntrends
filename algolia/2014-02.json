Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco.

This breakthrough technology helps banks provide financing to market segments previously out of reach, and helps bring the developing world\u0026#x27;s most capable, yet previously unbankable, entrepreneurs into the formal financial fold. After spinning off from a research initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School\u0026#x27;s Center for International Development, EFL now works with leading financial institutions across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and has facilitated over $240 million in lending to SMEs.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do \u0026quot;expense reports that don\u0026#x27;t suck!\u0026quot; (Google \u0026quot;expensify\u0026quot; to read more.) We\u0026#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u0026#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u0026#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won\u0026#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u0026#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u0026#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Super talented, in a general way. We\u0026#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing\u0026#x2F;designing\u0026#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you\u0026#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you\u0026#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u0026#x27;re this sort of person, you\u0026#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u0026#x27;t for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u0026#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u0026#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u0026#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u0026#x27;t accidentally overlook you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are probably many ways to do that.
