When I was 9 I began Calculus. However when I started these courses, I was capable of grasping these concepts in a deep level of intuition. Now I am advancing into Green\u0026#x27;s Theorem, Triple Integrals, Divergence, Curl, Gradient, and Partial Derivatives. In essence, I would just like to say thank you for providing this revolutionary interconnected education interface.

Think of how many similar students are born to learn advanced math and science but never get the chance. We\u0026#x27;re working to change this. This letter is one story; every month we hear about hundreds more lives like this that we\u0026#x27;ve totally transformed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#x27;re starting to do a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs right now. We\u0026#x27;re totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now you can build large parts of a product that\u0026#x27;s guaranteed to have millions of users. If you are (or you know) a mobile developer we can build a great team around, \u003Ci\u003Eplease reach out\u003C/i\u003E.

That\u0026#x27;s a huge number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this scale, we\u0026#x27;re able to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We\u0026#x27;ve run tests which show that students learn more when they\u0026#x27;re advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A\u0026#x2F;B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how Socratic-style lectures affect engagement.

We\u0026#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u0026#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u0026#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won\u0026#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u0026#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u0026#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Super talented, in a general way. We\u0026#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing\u0026#x2F;designing\u0026#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you\u0026#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you\u0026#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u0026#x27;re this sort of person, you\u0026#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u0026#x27;t for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u0026#x27;s a problem because while I know \u003Ci\u003Eyou\u003C/i\u003E are awesome, it\u0026#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u0026#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u0026#x27;t accidentally overlook you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are probably many ways to do that.

Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \u0026quot;layers\u0026quot;, so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it\u0026#x27;s running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you\u0026#x27;re not on the LAN.

We\u0026#x27;re also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files and other data on the go (even when you don\u0026#x27;t have a network connection), and currently finishing up a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There\u0026#x27;s also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0026#x27;re not per se a virtualization company: we don\u0026#x27;t write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that.

Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months.

Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, discovering clean energy amongst other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco.
