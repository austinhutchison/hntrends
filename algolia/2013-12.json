DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper\u0026#x2F;snail mail. We\u0026#x27;re talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more.
